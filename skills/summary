Work Experience
CCAT Collaboration NRC Herzberg
KIDS Readout Development Jan. - May 2022
• Designed a novel method of tone generation for Kinetic Inductance Detector Readout reducing memory by 99% compared to existing techniques.
• Optimized readout architecture significantly reducing resource utilization compared to previous generation readout systems.
• Designed and implemented gateware designs using Simulink and Vivado for the Xilinx RFSOC and verified their behavior in the lab.

Projects
Sailbots Design Team UBC
Controls Software Lead Sep. 2020 - Current
• Designed and Implemented a novel control system for an autonomous ocean-going sailboat using Python and ROS, building upon existing research in the field.
• Coordinated live testing of the boat, implementing solutions on the fly and generating useful feedback to improve the control system.
• Organized and held sub-team meetings and interviewed potential team members for recruitment.

Robotics Competition UBC
Engineering Physics Robot Competition May - August 2022
• Designed and built a robot using an STM-32 microcontroller to compete against other students in the program.
• Implemented an IMU based navigation system which used PID controllers and sensor filtering successfully navigate the competition course.
• Used signal processing knowledge to design a digital signal processing algorithm which could differentiate and track IR beacons of different frequencies.
• Analyzed different motor options and drive configurations for a drivetrain using CAD, documentation, and testing, before ultimately designing and building the robot drivetrain.
